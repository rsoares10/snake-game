# Snake Game

A classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Turtle library. The goal is to navigate the snake and eat as much food as possible without hitting the walls or the snake's tail.

## Game rules

- The snake continuously moves forward and never stops.
- The snake cannot hit the top, bottom, left, or right walls. If it does, the game is over.
- The snake cannot hit its own tail.
- The snake earns 1 point for each food item it eats.
- Each time the snake eats food, its tail increases by 1 block and a new food item is generated at a random position.
